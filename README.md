# NFTEarth enters NFTFi on Arbitrum! 

The frontend for the first NFT from NFTEarth on Arbitrum! 


# The current form of the app looks like this, but will likely be updated. 

In this short upcoming time period, the team will be deploying 4 applications consisting of 4 primary NFT contracts, all with different purposes. 

---

1. First there will be the 1155 NFT token contract for the Earth Drop NFT.
2. Second will be the ERC-721 staking rewards contract and app.
3. Third will be the contract for community rewards that splits the earnings of the protocol and NFT Minting revenues and distributes them to holders automatically on-chain.
4. Fourth will be the Earthling dNFT contract.

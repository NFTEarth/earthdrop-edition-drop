# NFTEarth enters NFTFi on Arbitrum! 

Here we are creating and deploy simple frontend for the claiming of ERC-1155 NFTs.


# The current form of the app looks like this, but will likely be updated. 

In this sprint we will be deploying 4 applications consisting of 4 primary NFT contracts all with different purposes. 

First, There will be the 1155 NFT token contract, the ERC-721 staking rewards contract, the Earthling dNFT contract, and the community rewards pool contract that splits the earnings of the protocol and distributes them to holders automatically on-chain.
